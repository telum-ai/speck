# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use speck-update-check.yml instead
#
# Template sync has been replaced by the Speck Update Action.
# This file will be removed in a future version.
#
# MIGRATION STEPS:
# 1. Delete this file (.github/workflows/template-sync.yml)
# 2. Delete .templatesyncignore (or rename to .speckignore)
# 3. Copy .github/workflows/speck-update-check.yml.sample to
#    .github/workflows/speck-update-check.yml
# 4. Create .speck/VERSION with your current version (e.g., v2.2.0)
#
# OR use the CLI for manual updates:
#   npx github:telum-ai/speck upgrade
#
# See .speck/DISTRIBUTION.md for full documentation.
