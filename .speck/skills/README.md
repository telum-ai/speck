# 🎯 Speck Skills

Agent Skills are **domain-specific expertise packages** that AI agents can discover and use automatically. Unlike commands (user-triggered) or rules (always-applied), skills are **agent-decided** - loaded on-demand when relevant to the current task.

## How Skills Work in Speck

```
Commands  → User triggers explicitly (/project-specify)
Rules     → Always applied or file-pattern based
Skills    → Agent decides based on task context (automatic)
```

When you're working on a task, the agent:
1. **Discovers** available skills from their names and descriptions
2. **Activates** relevant skills by loading their full instructions
3. **Applies** the domain expertise to the current task

## Enabling Skills in Cursor

1. Open **Cursor Settings** (Cmd+Shift+J / Ctrl+Shift+J)
2. Select **Beta** → Set update channel to **Nightly**
3. Restart Cursor after update
4. Go to **Settings → Rules → Import Settings**
5. Toggle **Agent Skills** on

## Relationship to Recipes

**Recipes** define WHAT technologies to use (stack choices).
**Skills** provide HOW to use them effectively (patterns & gotchas).

When a user picks a recipe like `nextjs-supabase`, the agent automatically has access to the Supabase skill for integration patterns.

---

## Creating New Skills

### 1. Create the Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .speck/skills/external-services/my-service
```

### 2. Create SKILL.md

**CRITICAL**: Every skill file MUST have YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`. This is how Cursor discovers and loads skills:

```markdown
---
name: my-service-integration
description: Integrate MyService for [functionality]. Use when implementing [specific features] or working with [MyService concepts].
---

# My Service Integration

Brief description of what this skill covers and when to use it.

## When to Use

Apply when implementing [specific features] or working with [concepts].

---

## Quick Start

[Minimal working example]

## Common Patterns

[Reusable code patterns]

## Common Gotchas

[Things that trip people up]

## Quick Reference

| Task | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| [Task 1] | [Pattern] |

## References

- [Link to docs]
```

### 3. Key Authoring Principles

1. **YAML frontmatter is REQUIRED** - Without `name` and `description`, the skill won't be discovered
2. **Description triggers loading** - Include specific keywords the agent will match on (e.g., "webhooks", "subscriptions", "RLS")
3. **Include MCP server if available** - Add a `🔌 MCP Server` section with install instructions when official/community MCP servers exist. In Speck template repos, prefer adding servers to `.cursor/mcp.project.json.example` and generating `.cursor/mcp.json` via `bash .speck/scripts/bash/merge-mcp-config.sh`.
4. **Be concise** - Every token competes for context space (aim for <500 lines)
5. **Assume intelligence** - Only add what Claude doesn't already know
6. **Focus on gotchas** - Document surprises, not obvious things
7. **Provide code** - Patterns are worth 1000 words
8. **Stay current** - Update when services change
9. **Third person** - "Provides patterns for..." not "I help you with..."
