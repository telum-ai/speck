## 📊 Information Sources

**Traceability**: This breakdown was created from:

- **Required Inputs**:
  - `epic.md` → User stories + acceptance criteria
  - `epic-tech-spec.md` → Technical approach and interfaces (REQUIRED)
- **Recommended Inputs**:
  - `epic-codebase-scan*.md` (brownfield) → Existing code to refactor/reuse
  - `PRD.md` / `context.md` / `architecture.md` → Constraints and sequencing considerations

## Summary

**Total Stories**: [Count]  
**Epic Dependencies**: [Other epics, if any]  
**Estimated Duration**: [Timeframe]  
**Parallelization Potential**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Story Organization

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

- [ ] S001 [Technical setup story]
  - **Type**: Technical
  - **Details**: [What to set up]
  - **References**: epic-tech-spec.md#[section]
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]

- [ ] S002 [Database setup] [P]
- [ ] S003 [API scaffolding] [P]
  - Can run in parallel (different concerns)

### Phase 2: Core Stories

- [ ] S004 [User Story 1.1 implementation]
  - **Story**: "As a [user], I want to [action]..."
  - **Technical Approach**: [From epic-tech-spec.md]
  - **Components**: [What to build]
  - **APIs**: [Endpoints/contracts]
  - **Tests**: [Key scenarios]
  - **References**: epic-tech-spec.md#[section]
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]

- [ ] S005 [User Story 1.2 implementation]
  - **Story**: "As a [user], I want to [action]..."
  - **Depends on**: S004
  - **References**: epic-tech-spec.md#[section]

### Phase 3: Integration Stories *(parallel when safe)*

- [ ] S010 [Story 2.1] [P]
- [ ] S011 [Story 2.2] [P]
- [ ] S012 [Story 2.3] [P]
  - These can run in parallel (independent features)

### Phase 4: Quality & Polish

- [ ] S020 Integration testing / E2E coverage
- [ ] S021 Performance validation / optimization
- [ ] S022 Documentation updates
- [ ] S023 Security review / hardening

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]
- Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]

**Technical Implementation (high level)**:
1. [Step]
2. [Step]
3. [Step]

**Code Patterns / Reuse**:
- [Reference to epic-tech-spec.md or epic-codebase-scan*.md]

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit: [What to test]

## Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution Groups

**Group A** (Can run simultaneously):
- S002, S003

**Group B** (After Phase 1):
- S010, S011, S012

### Critical Path

S001 → S004 → S005 → S020 → Complete

### Resource Allocation (Example)

- Phase 1: 1 developer
- Phase 2: 2 developers
- Phase 3: 3 developers (parallel)
- Phase 4: 2 developers

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- [Service/API]: Needed by [Story]
- [Library]: Needed by [Story]

### Inter-Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Provides To |
|------|------------|-------------|
| S005 | S004 | S020 |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Story | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| S004 | [Risk] | [Action] |

---

## Definition of Done

Per Story:
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (as applicable)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified

Epic Complete:
- [ ] All stories done
- [ ] E2E tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off

---

## Next Steps

1. Create story directories under `[EPIC_DIR]/stories/`
2. Start with Phase 1 stories (`/story-specify` → `/story-plan` → `/story-tasks` → `/story-analyze` → `/story-implement`)
3. Optionally run `/epic-analyze` to validate breakdown quality before starting
