## Inheritance Rules

### How This Context Applies

**Project Level**:
- All constraints are mandatory
- Define boundaries for architecture

**Epic Level**:
- Inherit all project constraints
- May add epic-specific constraints
- Cannot relax project constraints

**Story Level**:
- Inherit all project + epic constraints
- Must implement within constraints
- Escalate if constraints block implementation

### Conflict Resolution
- Project constraints override epic constraints
- Compliance requirements override preferences
- Document any approved exceptions
