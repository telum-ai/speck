## 📊 Information Sources
 
**Traceability**: This roadmap was created from the following sources:
 
- **Required Inputs**:
  - `PRD.md` → Epics, priorities, scope (REQUIRED)
  - `epics.md` → Epic list and metadata (REQUIRED)
- **Recommended Inputs**:
  - `architecture.md` → Technical sequencing constraints
  - `context.md` → Team/budget/timeline constraints
  - `ux-strategy.md` → UX dependencies and sequencing considerations
  - `design-system.md` → UI dependencies (if design system work is gated)
 
**Information Flow**:
```
PRD.md + epics.md + [architecture/context/ux/design-system]
  ↓
project-roadmap.md (this document)
  ↓
epic execution (specify → plan → breakdown → stories)
```

## Strategy
 
**Execution Strategy**: [Sequential/Parallel/Hybrid]  
**Timeline**: [Estimated duration]  
**Team Size**: [Recommended]  
**Cadence**: [e.g., 1–2 week sprints, continuous delivery]
 
**Rationale**:
- [Why this strategy fits the team and risk profile]

## Epic Execution Plan
 
### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] E000 Developer Infrastructure (~[X] stories) *(optional but recommended)*
  - **Why First**: [Rationale]
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]
  - **Team**: [Size/skills needed]
  - **Success Gate**: [What marks completion]
 
- [ ] E001 [Epic Name] (~[X] stories)
  - **Why First**: [Rationale]
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]
  - **Team**: [Size/skills needed]
  - **Success Gate**: [What marks completion]
 
### Phase 2: Core Features *(can run in parallel when safe)*
- [ ] E002 [Epic Name] (~[X] stories) [P]
  - **Dependencies**: [None / E001 / E000]
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]
  - **Team**: [Team A / Skills]
  - **Success Gate**: [What marks completion]
 
- [ ] E003 [Epic Name] (~[X] stories) [P]
  - **Dependencies**: [None / E001 / E000]
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]
  - **Team**: [Team B / Skills]
  - **Success Gate**: [What marks completion]
 
### Phase 3: Integration / Enhancement *(depends on Phase 2)*
- [ ] E004 [Epic Name]
  - **Dependencies**: E002, E003 complete
  - **Duration**: [Estimate]
  - **Team**: [Team/Skills]
  - **Success Gate**: [What marks completion]

## Execution Timeline (Calendar View)
 
```
Week 1-2:   [E000: Developer Infrastructure] (if included)
Week 1-4:   [E001: Foundation Epic]
Week 5-8:   [E002: Feature A] [P]
            [E003: Feature B] [P]
Week 9-12:  [E004: Integration / Hardening]
Week 13-14: [Project validation & launch]
```
 
**Critical Path**: [List epics in order, e.g., E001 → E002 → E004] ([X] weeks minimum)

## Risk Mitigation Plan
 
| Epic | Risk Type | Risk | Mitigation | Trigger |
|------|----------|------|------------|---------|
| E001 | Technical | [Unknown integration] | [Spike in week 1] | [If blocked >2 days] |
| E002 | Business | [Revenue dependency] | [Stakeholder review cadence] | [If scope changes] |
 
---
 
## Resource Allocation
 
### Team Structure
- **Team A**: [Epics assigned]
- **Team B**: [Epics assigned]
- **Shared/Platform**: [Architecture/DevOps/Design]
 
### Skill Requirements by Phase
| Phase | Skills Needed | Source |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | [Backend, DevOps, QA] | [Team/Hire/Contract] |
| 2 | [Frontend, UX, API] | [Team/Hire/Contract] |
| 3 | [Integration, Perf, Security] | [Team/Hire/Contract] |

## Success Metrics Tracking
 
### Per Epic
- E001: [Key metric] = [Target]
- E002: [Key metric] = [Target]
 
### Project Level
- Overall: [Metric] = [Target]
- Launch criteria:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]

## Parallel Execution Commands (Operational)
 
When parallel execution is safe, you can run epic planning in parallel:
 
Terminal 1:
- `/epic-specify "E002: [Epic Name]"`
- `/epic-plan`
- `/epic-breakdown`
 
Terminal 2:
- `/epic-specify "E003: [Epic Name]"`
- `/epic-plan`
- `/epic-breakdown`
 
---
 
## Integration Checkpoints
 
- After each epic completes (run `/epic-validate`)
- Before starting dependent epics
- At phase boundaries (re-check architecture/context constraints)
- Pre-launch validation (`/project-validate`)
 
---
 
## Visual Timeline (Gantt-ish)
 
```
E000: |██████|                                       Developer Infrastructure
E001: |████████████████|                               Foundation
E002:                 |████████████|                   Feature A
E003:                 |████████████|                   Feature B
E004:                               |████████|          Integration / Hardening
```

## Next Steps
 
1. Review roadmap with stakeholders
2. Assign epic owners
3. Begin Phase 1 by running:
   - `/epic-specify "E001: [Epic Name]"`
