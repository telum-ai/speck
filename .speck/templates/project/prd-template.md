## 📊 Information Sources

**Traceability**: This PRD was created from the following sources:

- **Required Inputs**:
  - `project.md` → Project vision and goals
  - `architecture.md` → Technical architecture and constraints (REQUIRED!)
  - `ux-strategy.md` → UX principles and user journeys
  - `context.md` → Constraints and requirements
- **Optional Inputs**:
  - `design-system.md` → UI component inventory and tokens
  - `constitution.md` → Technical principles

**Note**: Research findings are embedded in upstream artifacts (architecture.md, ux-strategy.md, context.md) - no separate research.md file.
- **Brownfield** (if applicable):
  - `project-landscape-overview.md` → Existing feature inventory for epic identification

**Information Flow**:
```
project.md + architecture.md + ux-strategy + context + [design-system/constitution/research/landscape-overview]
  ↓
PRD.md (this document) + epics.md
  ↓
Epic development (each epic references relevant sections)
```

**Critical Note**: Architecture decisions made BEFORE this PRD ensure realistic epic breakdown and technical feasibility.
