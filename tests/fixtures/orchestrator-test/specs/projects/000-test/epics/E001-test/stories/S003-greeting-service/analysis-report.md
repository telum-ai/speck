## Coverage Summary

| Requirement | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| FR-001 | ✅ | T001, T002 | Accept name parameter |
| FR-002 | ✅ | T001, T002 | Return formatted greeting |
| FR-003 | ✅ | T001, T002 | Handle empty names |

**Coverage Analysis**: All 3 functional requirements fully covered. T001 provides test coverage, T002 provides implementation.

---

## Findings

No issues detected. All quality gates passed.

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| - | - | - | - | No issues found | Continue to implementation |

---

## Constitution Alignment

No project constitution exists. Default quality principles satisfied:
- ✅ Code Quality: Pure function, single responsibility
- ✅ Test Coverage: 100% coverage, all scenarios tested
- ✅ Performance: <5ms target easily achievable

---

## Research Alignment

Research recommendations properly integrated:
- ✅ Pure function pattern documented in plan.md
- ✅ String.prototype.trim() usage specified
- ✅ No external dependencies required

All research decisions from plan.md are reflected in tasks.md implementation approach.

---

## Codebase Pattern Adherence

N/A - No codebase scans available (greenfield implementation).

Directory structure follows architecture.md conventions:
- `src/services/` for service layer ✅
- `tests/unit/` for unit tests ✅

---

## Information Flow Analysis

**FR Traceability**: 100% (3/3 FRs explicitly mapped to tasks)

**Task Context Richness**: 100% (2/2 tasks include "Implements: FR-XXX")

**Research Preservation**: 100% (pure function pattern preserved from plan.md)

**Context Loss Score**: 0% (no information loss detected)

---

## Next Actions

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Ready for implementation

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. ✅ Proceed to `/story-implement` (execute tasks)
2. Run `/story-validate` after implementation to verify completion

### Quality Gates Status:
- ✅ All requirements have implementing tasks
- ✅ All tasks reference requirements (FR-XXX)
- ✅ No critical issues remaining
- ✅ Constitution principles satisfied (default principles)
- ✅ Research recommendations applied
- ✅ Test-driven development approach (tests before implementation)

---

## Checklist

- [x] All requirements have implementing tasks
- [x] All tasks reference requirements (FR-XXX)
- [x] No critical issues remaining
- [x] Constitution principles satisfied
- [x] Research recommendations applied
- [x] Codebase patterns referenced (N/A - greenfield)
- [x] TDD approach (tests before implementation)
- [x] Performance targets defined
- [x] File paths specified
- [x] Task execution order clear

---

## Detailed Analysis

### Requirement Coverage
- **FR-001**: Covered by T001 (test) and T002 (implementation)
- **FR-002**: Covered by T001 (test) and T002 (implementation)
- **FR-003**: Covered by T001 (test) and T002 (implementation)

### Task Quality
- **T001**: Well-defined test task with explicit test cases, follows Vitest patterns
- **T002**: Clear implementation task with code pattern, performance target, file path

### Artifact Consistency
- spec.md ↔ plan.md: All requirements from spec reflected in plan ✅
- plan.md ↔ tasks.md: Technical approach and patterns preserved ✅
- data-model.md: Function signature consistent with implementation ✅
- quickstart.md: Test scenarios match T001 test cases ✅

### TDD Compliance
- Tests (T001) scheduled before implementation (T002) ✅
- Tests designed to fail until implementation complete ✅
- All acceptance scenarios from spec.md covered in tests ✅

### Performance Validation
- NFR-001 target (<5ms) specified in tasks.md ✅
- Performance validation approach defined (unit test timing) ✅
- Expected performance documented (<0.01ms for pure function) ✅
