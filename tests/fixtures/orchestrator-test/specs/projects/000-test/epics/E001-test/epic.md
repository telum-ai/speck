# Epic: Core Greeting Functionality

## Overview

Implement the basic greeting API with all required components: project setup, API endpoint, service layer, and validation.

## Goals

1. Set up project structure with TypeScript and Express
2. Implement the `/greet` endpoint
3. Add input validation
4. Achieve 100% test coverage

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Project runs with `npm start`
- [ ] GET `/greet?name=World` returns `{"message": "Hello, World!"}`
- [ ] Invalid requests return proper error responses
- [ ] All tests pass

## Dependencies

None - this is the first epic.
