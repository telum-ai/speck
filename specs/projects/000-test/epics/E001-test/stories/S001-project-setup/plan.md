# Implementation Plan: Project Setup

**Branch**: `S001-project-setup` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Story specification from `specs/projects/000-test/epics/E001-test/stories/S001-project-setup/spec.md`

## Summary

Initialize a TypeScript project with Express framework, including package.json, tsconfig.json, and basic project structure to enable API development.

---

## Technical Approach

This story sets up the foundational project structure using Node.js and TypeScript. We'll use npm to initialize the project, add TypeScript and Express dependencies, configure the TypeScript compiler for Node.js, and establish a standard source directory structure. The approach follows Node.js best practices with separate src and dist directories.

## Dependencies
- Requires: None (foundational story)
- Provides: Project structure for all subsequent stories (S002-S010)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Verify package.json structure, tsconfig.json validity
- Integration tests: Compile and run the initialized project
- Contract tests: N/A

---

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 20.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express 4.x, @types/express, @types/node  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: Jest or similar (to be configured in later story)  
**Target Platform**: Node.js server  
**Project Type**: single (backend API)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast startup (< 2s), quick build (< 5s)  
**Constraints**: Use standard npm conventions  
**Scale/Scope**: Small API project, ~10 endpoints

## Constitution Check

**Product Principles**:
- Simplicity: Use standard tooling without unnecessary complexity
- Developer Experience: Clear npm scripts, sensible defaults

**Technical Excellence**:
- Code Quality: TypeScript for type safety
- Quality Assurance: Structure supports testing (to be added in later stories)
- Performance: Fast compilation and startup
- UX Standards: N/A (backend infrastructure)

**Brand Alignment**: N/A (infrastructure story)

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)
```
specs/projects/000-test/epics/E001-test/stories/S001-project-setup/
├── spec.md                  # Story specification
└── plan.md                  # This file
```

### Source Code (repository root)
```
src/
├── index.ts                 # Entry point (minimal)

dist/                        # Build output
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure appropriate for a backend API. Source code in src/, compiled output in dist/.

## Research Informing This Plan

No additional research required - using standard Node.js/TypeScript/Express setup patterns.

---

## Phase 1: Design Artifacts

### Phase 1.1: Contracts
No API contracts for this infrastructure story.

### Phase 1.2: Data Model
No data model for this infrastructure story.

### Phase 1.3: Quickstart Scenarios

```markdown
# Quickstart: Project Setup

## Scenario 1: Initialize and Build
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
3. Verify dist/ directory contains compiled JavaScript

## Scenario 2: Start the Application  
1. Run `npm start`
2. Verify application starts without errors
3. Application should be ready for Express server configuration (next story)
```

---

## Phase 1.5: Implementation Guidance

### FR → Task Mapping
| FR ID | Requirement | Tasks |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| FR-001 | Initialize package.json | T001 |
| FR-002 | Include TypeScript dev dependency | T002 |
| FR-003 | Include Express and types | T002 |
| FR-004 | Configure tsconfig.json | T003 |
| FR-005 | Provide npm scripts | T004 |

### Codebase Patterns for Reuse
Standard Node.js/TypeScript project initialization. No existing patterns to reuse.

---

## Phase 2: Task Decomposition Plan

Tasks will be generated by /story-tasks command and will include:
1. Initialize package.json with npm init
2. Install TypeScript, Express, and type definitions
3. Create tsconfig.json with Node.js configuration
4. Create basic src/ structure with index.ts
5. Add build and start scripts to package.json
6. Verify project compiles and runs

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Technical Context filled
- [x] Initial Constitution Check passed
- [x] Phase 1 artifacts planned (contracts, data-model, quickstart)
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check (after Phase 1 execution)
- [ ] Ready for /story-tasks
